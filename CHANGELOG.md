## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-09

### Breaking Changes
- Major refactoring of authentication mechanism:
  - Rust client now uses factory-like pattern with `with_token()`, `with_server()`, `with_login()` extensions
  - Base `new()` method is now barebones; authentication methods add fields to Client
  - Python parameter ordering adjusted
  - Added parameter to disable loading tokens from disk
- Introduced strongly-typed `ID` type for object identifiers (replacing generic strings)
- `TrainerSession` renamed to `TrainingSession`
- Major Python client interface refactoring

### Added
- COCO label index/name support with tests
- Derive traits for `Label` type
- File upload and download APIs for sessions
- Metrics API for `TrainingSession` and `ValidationSession`
- Validation session support
- Task API support with filtering
- Label management support for datasets (CLI and API)
- Annotations and annotations_dataframe methods to Python client
- `Project` and `Dataset` Python classes with full method implementations
- Upload and download checkpoint functionality
- Upload artifact with automatic server path configuration
- Token parsing and renewal functions
- Organization query support
- Model parameters for `TrainingSession`
- Nested parameters support in `ValidationSession`

### Changed
- Refactored `download_artifact` API to allow default parameters for local path
- Updated `set_stages` API to use array of tuples instead of HashMap (preserves ordering)
- Workspace restructured with split crates
- Save images with correct extension for given image file format

### Fixed
- Login function now uses `rpc_without_auth`
- Python tests now passing

---

## [1.3.6] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- Default Python parameters for `restore_snapshot_sync` API

---

## [1.3.5] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- Raise error from `upload_multipart` instead of unwrapping on progress feedback

---

## [1.3.4] - 2025-05-02

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `annotations_sync` function from Python

---

## [1.3.3] - 2025-04-30

### Added
- Progress feedback to annotations download (improves UX for slow operations)

### Changed
- Updated Cargo dependencies
- Added `.gitignore` rule for `*.arrow` files

### Fixed
- Fixed annotations feedback progress when multiple annotation types are requested

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-04-16

### Fixed
- When combining annotations, use `object_id+image_id` as the key to ensure uniqueness across frames

### Changed
- Use `*.edgefirst.studio` URL instead of `*.dveml.com`

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-04-10

- The annotations function will provide box2d using center-points (yolo format)
    - Studio uses top-left (coco format) internally but we document center-points.
- The annotations_list function is now private.
- Trainer renamed to Experiement to match the EdgeFirst Studio terminology in the UI.
    - Previously Trainer was used which is the terminology used by the REST API.
    - Functions `trainers`, `trainer`, `find_trainers` renamed to `experiements`, `experiment`, `find_experiments`.
- The `find_item` functions have been renamed `find_items` to emphasize that multiple matches can be returned.
- Functions returning objects instead of object_id have been added throughout the API.
    - For example Experiment can return the parent Project directly instead of project_id.
    - As well Experiement can return the list of TrainingSessions directly instead of having to use the Experiement ID when calling the `Client::training_sessions`.
- TrainingDataset has been renamed DatasetParams and the `TrainingSession::dataset()` renamed `TrainingSession::dataset_params()`.
