## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `Client::populate_samples()` now automatically uploads local files to S3
  - Removed `presigned_urls` parameter - file uploads are now automatic
  - When `SampleFile` filename is a valid local file path, the file is uploaded automatically
  - API request uses basename only, full path handled internally
- **BREAKING**: Fixed field serialization names to match EdgeFirst Studio API
  - `Sample.location` now serializes as `"sensors"` (GPS/IMU data)
  - `Annotation.object_id` now serializes as `"object_reference"`
  - `Annotation.label` now serializes as `"label_name"`
  - These fields can still be deserialized from their original names for backward compatibility
- **BREAKING**: Simplified `Sample` field types for better ergonomics
  - `Sample.files` changed from `Option<Vec<SampleFile>>` to `Vec<SampleFile>` with `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]`
  - `Sample.annotations` changed from `Option<Vec<Annotation>>` to `Vec<Annotation>` with same serde attributes
  - Empty vectors serialize as JSON `null` / deserialize from missing fields as empty vec
  - Eliminates verbose `Some(vec![...])` wrapping in user code
- **BREAKING**: `Sample.uuid` now auto-generated when `None`
  - `populate_samples()` generates UUIDv4 for samples without explicit UUIDs
  - Users can still provide deterministic UUIDs by setting `sample.uuid = Some("custom-uuid")`
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to remove deprecated actions
- Replaced `actions/create-release@v1` with `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`
- Replaced `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` with `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`
- Updated dependencies

### Added
- Automatic file upload in `populate_samples()` - detects local files and uploads to presigned S3 URLs
- Automatic UUID generation for samples in `populate_samples()` using UUIDv4
- Example `populate_with_circle.rs` demonstrating bbox annotations with auto-generated image and UUID
- Example `populate_with_annotations.rs` demonstrating location (sensors) usage with populate API
- Added `cargo-license` tool to Docker build image
- Auto-generate `THIRD_PARTY` file listing all third-party dependencies and their licenses
- Added `uuid` crate dependency (v1.11.0) with v4 and serde features

### Changed (License)
- Updated project license to Apache-2.0

### Added
- Comprehensive API documentation throughout the codebase
- CLI testing support with unit tests
- Python coverage reporting (coverage.xml)

### Changed
- Replaced generic `ID` type with strongly typed ID classes for better type safety

- `client::with_token` now returns self instead of error when given an empty token
- Reorganized CI/CD parallel builds based on dependencies
- Moved Python examples to dedicated examples folder

### Fixed
- Handle missing `project_id` in `TaskInfo`
- Correctly handle `STUDIO_USERNAME`/`STUDIO_PASSWORD` or `STUDIO_TOKEN` from CLI

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-09

### Breaking Changes
- Major refactoring of authentication mechanism:
  - Rust client now uses factory-like pattern with `with_token()`, `with_server()`, `with_login()` extensions
  - Base `new()` method is now barebones; authentication methods add fields to Client
  - Python parameter ordering adjusted
  - Added parameter to disable loading tokens from disk
- Introduced strongly-typed `ID` type for object identifiers (replacing generic strings)
- `TrainerSession` renamed to `TrainingSession`
- Major Python client interface refactoring

### Added
- COCO label index/name support with tests
- Derive traits for `Label` type
- File upload and download APIs for sessions
- Metrics API for `TrainingSession` and `ValidationSession`
- Validation session support
- Task API support with filtering
- Label management support for datasets (CLI and API)
- Annotations and annotations_dataframe methods to Python client
- `Project` and `Dataset` Python classes with full method implementations
- Upload and download checkpoint functionality
- Upload artifact with automatic server path configuration
- Token parsing and renewal functions
- Organization query support
- Model parameters for `TrainingSession`
- Nested parameters support in `ValidationSession`

### Changed
- Refactored `download_artifact` API to allow default parameters for local path
- Updated `set_stages` API to use array of tuples instead of HashMap (preserves ordering)
- Workspace restructured with split crates
- Save images with correct extension for given image file format

### Fixed
- Login function now uses `rpc_without_auth`
- Python tests now passing

---

## [1.3.6] - 2025-05-28

---

## [1.3.5] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed

---

## [1.3.3] - 2025-04-30

### Added
- Progress feedback to annotations download (improves UX for slow operations)

### Changed

- Added `.gitignore` rule for `*.arrow` files

### Fixed
- Fixed annotations feedback progress when multiple annotation types are requested

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-04-16

### Fixed
- When combining annotations, use `object_id+image_id` as the key to ensure uniqueness across frames

### Changed
- Use `*.edgefirst.studio` URL instead of `*.dveml.com`

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-04-10

- The annotations function will provide box2d using center-points (yolo format)
    - Studio uses top-left (coco format) internally but we document center-points.
- The annotations_list function is now private.
- Trainer renamed to Experiement to match the EdgeFirst Studio terminology in the UI.
    - Previously Trainer was used which is the terminology used by the REST API.
    - Functions `trainers`, `trainer`, `find_trainers` renamed to `experiements`, `experiment`, `find_experiments`.
- The `find_item` functions have been renamed `find_items` to emphasize that multiple matches can be returned.
- Functions returning objects instead of object_id have been added throughout the API.
    - For example Experiment can return the parent Project directly instead of project_id.
    - As well Experiement can return the list of TrainingSessions directly instead of having to use the Experiement ID when calling the `Client::training_sessions`.
- TrainingDataset has been renamed DatasetParams and the `TrainingSession::dataset()` renamed `TrainingSession::dataset_params()`.
